## Database migrations
- Use /SQL folder to store any DB schema migrations user has to run manually in Supabase. 
- Once done user will move these to /SQL/archive. 
- Make sure you write a test for every schema to check its correctly implemented in the DB. Add it to the test suite.
-  Add timestamps to the front of the .sql filenames to keep it tidy.
